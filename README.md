# End-to-end-Machine-Learning-Project-with-MLflow
Here we are going to predict the amount to be sanctioned to client based on the available data. Instead of predicting whether to issue loan or not in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ ,here we have to predict the loan issue amount.We are going to discuss and implement data visualisation and then feature engineering, feature selection and at last model selection and evaluation.

Steps:
1. Dataset Description
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training and Evaluation
6. Comparison

## Workflows

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update schema.yaml
3. Update params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline 
8. Update the main.py
9. Update the app.py
